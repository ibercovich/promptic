The number we are multiplying is called the <b>base</b>, and the number of times we multiply it is called the <b>exponent</b>.</p><p>For example, 3<sup>4</sup> means we are multiplying 3 by itself 4 times: 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 81.</p>","tutorNotes":"<p>Give a brief definition of exponentiation.</p><p>Introduce the terms base and exponent.</p><p>Provide an example of exponentiation using numbers and explain how it works.</p>"},{"title":"Relating Exponentiation to Sum and Multiplication","content":"<p>Let's think about exponentiation in terms of <b>sum</b> and <b>multiplication</b>.</p><p><b>Sum</b> is adding a number to itself: 3 + 3 = 6. <b>Multiplication</b> is like repeated sum: 3 x 3 = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9. And <b>exponentiation</b> is like repeated multiplication: 3<sup>3</sup> = 3 x 3 x 3 = 27.</p>","tutorNotes":"<p>Explain how exponentiation is related to sum and multiplication.</p><p>Provide examples of sum, multiplication, and exponentiation to illustrate the relationship between them.</p>"},{"title":"Explore: Exponentiation with Laura","content":"<p>Let's practice exponentiation together! ðŸ˜„</p><p>What is 2<sup>3</sup>?
